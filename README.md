# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* test from AW. Now added this bit for another test

* I created this on my Macbook. In Github it's called devcamp. The directory structure is DEV_CAMP/DevcampPortfolio.  The devcamp-portfolio repo on GitHUB is the origianl (old) one I created on my IMac.  Be careful.
